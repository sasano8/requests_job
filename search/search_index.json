HTTPX is a fully featured HTTP client for Python 3, which provides sync and async APIs, and support for both HTTP/1.1 and HTTP/2. Note HTTPX should currently be considered in beta. We believe we've got the public API to a stable point now, but would strongly recommend pinning your dependencies to the 0.18.* release, so that you're able to properly review API changes between package updates . A 1.0 release is expected to be issued sometime in 2021.

Why use a Client? TL;DR If you do anything more than experimentation, one-off scripts, or prototypes, then you should use a Client instance. More efficient usage of network resources When you make requests using the top-level API as documented in the Quickstart guide, HTTPX has to establish a new connection for every single request (connections are not reused). As the number of requests to a host increases, this quickly becomes inefficient. On the other hand, a Client instance uses HTTP connection pooling . This means that when you make several requests to the same host, the Client will reuse the underlying TCP connection, instead of recreating one for every single request. This can bring significant performance improvements compared to using the top-level API, including: Reduced latency across requests (no handshaking). Reduced CPU usage and round-trips. Reduced network congestion. Extra features Client instances also support features that aren't available at the top-level API, such as: Cookie persistance across requests. Applying configuration across all outgoing requests. Sending requests through HTTP proxies. Using HTTP/2 . The other sections on this page go into further detail about what you can do with a Client instance. Usage The recommended way to use a Client is as a context manager. This will ensure that connections are properly cleaned up when leaving the with block: with httpx . Client () as client : ... Alternatively, you can explicitly close the connection pool without block-usage using .close() : client = httpx . Client () try : ... finally : client . close () Making requests Once you have a Client , you can send requests using .get() , .post() , etc. For example: >>> with httpx . Client () as client : ... r = client . get ( 'https://example.com' ) ... >>> r <Response [200 OK]> These methods accept the same arguments as httpx.get() , httpx.post() , etc. This means that all features documented in the Quickstart guide are also available at the client level. For example, to send a request with custom headers: >>> with httpx . Client () as client : ... headers = { 'X-Custom' : 'value' } ... r = client . get ( 'https://example.com' , headers = headers ) ... >>> r . request . headers [ 'X-Custom' ] 'value' Sharing configuration across requests Clients allow you to apply configuration to all outgoing requests by passing parameters to the Client constructor. For example, to apply a set of custom headers on every request : >>> url = 'http://httpbin.org/headers' >>> headers = { 'user-agent' : 'my-app/0.0.1' } >>> with httpx . Client ( headers = headers ) as client : ... r = client . get ( url ) ... >>> r . json ()[ 'headers' ][ 'User-Agent' ] 'my-app/0.0.1' Merging of configuration When a configuration option is provided at both the client-level and request-level, one of two things can happen: For headers, query parameters and cookies, the values are combined together. For example: >>> headers = { 'X-Auth' : 'from-client' } >>> params = { 'client_id' : 'client1' } >>> with httpx . Client ( headers = headers , params = params ) as client : ... headers = { 'X-Custom' : 'from-request' } ... params = { 'request_id' : 'request1' } ... r = client . get ( 'https://example.com' , headers = headers , params = params ) ... >>> r . request . url URL('https://example.com?client_id=client1&request_id=request1') >>> r . request . headers [ 'X-Auth' ] 'from-client' >>> r . request . headers [ 'X-Custom' ] 'from-request' For all other parameters, the request-level value takes priority. For example: >>> with httpx . Client ( auth = ( 'tom' , 'mot123' )) as client : ... r = client . get ( 'https://example.com' , auth = ( 'alice' , 'ecila123' )) ... >>> _ , _ , auth = r . request . headers [ 'Authorization' ] . partition ( ' ' ) >>> import base64 >>> base64 . b64decode ( auth ) b'alice:ecila123' If you need finer-grained control on the merging of client-level and request-level parameters, see Request instances . Other Client-only configuration options Additionally, Client accepts some configuration options that aren't available at the request level. For example, base_url allows you to prepend an URL to all outgoing requests: >>> with httpx . Client ( base_url = 'http://httpbin.org' ) as client : ... r = client . get ( '/headers' ) ... >>> r . request . url URL('http://httpbin.org/headers') For a list of all available client parameters, see the Client API reference. Calling into Python Web Apps You can configure an httpx client to call directly into a Python web application using the WSGI protocol. This is particularly useful for two main use-cases: Using httpx as a client inside test cases. Mocking out external services during tests or in dev/staging environments. Here's an example of integrating against a Flask application: from flask import Flask import httpx app = Flask ( __name__ ) @app . route ( \"/\" ) def hello (): return \"Hello World!\" with httpx . Client ( app = app , base_url = \"http://testserver\" ) as client : r = client . get ( \"/\" ) assert r . status_code == 200 assert r . text == \"Hello World!\" For some more complex cases you might need to customize the WSGI transport. This allows you to: Inspect 500 error responses rather than raise exceptions by setting raise_app_exceptions=False . Mount the WSGI application at a subpath by setting script_name (WSGI). Use a given client address for requests by setting remote_addr (WSGI). For example: # Instantiate a client that makes WSGI requests with a client IP of \"1.2.3.4\". transport = httpx . WSGITransport ( app = app , remote_addr = \"1.2.3.4\" ) with httpx . Client ( transport = transport , base_url = \"http://testserver\" ) as client : ... Request instances For maximum control on what gets sent over the wire, HTTPX supports building explicit Request instances: request = httpx . Request ( \"GET\" , \"https://example.com\" ) To dispatch a Request instance across to the network, create a Client instance and use .send() : with httpx . Client () as client : response = client . send ( request ) ... If you need to mix client-level and request-level options in a way that is not supported by the default Merging of parameters , you can use .build_request() and then make arbitrary modifications to the Request instance. For example: headers = { \"X-Api-Key\" : \"...\" , \"X-Client-ID\" : \"ABC123\" } with httpx . Client ( headers = headers ) as client : request = client . build_request ( \"GET\" , \"https://api.example.com\" ) print ( request . headers [ \"X-Client-ID\" ]) # \"ABC123\" # Don't send the API key for this particular request. del request . headers [ \"X-Api-Key\" ] response = client . send ( request ) ... Event Hooks HTTPX allows you to register \"event hooks\" with the client, that are called every time a particular type of event takes place. There are currently two event hooks: request - Called after a request is fully prepared, but before it is sent to the network. Passed the request instance. response - Called after the response has been fetched from the network, but before it is returned to the caller. Passed the response instance. These allow you to install client-wide functionality such as logging, monitoring or tracing. def log_request ( request ): print ( f \"Request event hook: { request . method } { request . url } - Waiting for response\" ) def log_response ( response ): request = response . request print ( f \"Response event hook: { request . method } { request . url } - Status { response . status_code } \" ) client = httpx . Client ( event_hooks = { 'request' : [ log_request ], 'response' : [ log_response ]}) You can also use these hooks to install response processing code, such as this example, which creates a client instance that always raises httpx.HTTPStatusError on 4xx and 5xx responses. def raise_on_4xx_5xx ( response ): response . raise_for_status () client = httpx . Client ( event_hooks = { 'response' : [ raise_on_4xx_5xx ]}) The hooks are also allowed to modify request and response objects. def add_timestamp ( request ): request . headers [ 'x-request-timestamp' ] = datetime . now ( tz = datetime . utc ) . isoformat () client = httpx . Client ( event_hooks = { 'request' : [ add_timestamp ]}) Event hooks must always be set as a list of callables , and you may register multiple event hooks for each type of event. As well as being able to set event hooks on instantiating the client, there is also an .event_hooks property, that allows you to inspect and modify the installed hooks. client = httpx . Client () client . event_hooks [ 'request' ] = [ log_request ] client . event_hooks [ 'response' ] = [ log_response , raise_on_4xx_5xx ] Note If you are using HTTPX's async support, then you need to be aware that hooks registered with httpx.AsyncClient MUST be async functions, rather than plain functions. Monitoring download progress If you need to monitor download progress of large responses, you can use response streaming and inspect the response.num_bytes_downloaded property. This interface is required for properly determining download progress, because the total number of bytes returned by response.content or response.iter_content() will not always correspond with the raw content length of the response if HTTP response compression is being used. For example, showing a progress bar using the tqdm library while a response is being downloaded could be done like this\u2026 import tempfile import httpx from tqdm import tqdm with tempfile . NamedTemporaryFile () as download_file : url = \"https://speed.hetzner.de/100MB.bin\" with httpx . stream ( \"GET\" , url ) as response : total = int ( response . headers [ \"Content-Length\" ]) with tqdm ( total = total , unit_scale = True , unit_divisor = 1024 , unit = \"B\" ) as progress : num_bytes_downloaded = response . num_bytes_downloaded for chunk in response . iter_bytes (): download_file . write ( chunk ) progress . update ( response . num_bytes_downloaded - num_bytes_downloaded ) num_bytes_downloaded = response . num_bytes_downloaded Or an alternate example, this time using the rich library\u2026 import tempfile import httpx import rich.progress with tempfile . NamedTemporaryFile () as download_file : url = \"https://speed.hetzner.de/100MB.bin\" with httpx . stream ( \"GET\" , url ) as response : total = int ( response . headers [ \"Content-Length\" ]) with rich . progress . Progress ( \"[progress.percentage] {task.percentage:>3.0f} %\" , rich . progress . BarColumn ( bar_width = None ), rich . progress . DownloadColumn (), rich . progress . TransferSpeedColumn (), ) as progress : download_task = progress . add_task ( \"Download\" , total = total ) for chunk in response . iter_bytes (): download_file . write ( chunk ) progress . update ( download_task , completed = response . num_bytes_downloaded ) .netrc Support HTTPX supports .netrc file. In trust_env=True cases, if auth parameter is not defined, HTTPX tries to add auth into request's header from .netrc file. Note The NETRC file is cached across requests made by a client. If you need to refresh the cache (e.g. because the NETRC file has changed), you should create a new client or restart the interpreter. As default trust_env is true. To set false: >>> httpx . get ( 'https://example.org/' , trust_env = False ) If NETRC environment is empty, HTTPX tries to use default files. ( ~/.netrc , ~/_netrc ) To change NETRC environment: >>> import os >>> os . environ [ \"NETRC\" ] = \"my_default_folder/.my_netrc\" .netrc file content example: machine netrcexample.org login example-username password example-password ... When using Client instances, trust_env should be set on the client itself, rather than on the request methods: client = httpx . Client ( trust_env = False ) HTTP Proxying HTTPX supports setting up HTTP proxies via the proxies parameter to be passed on client initialization or top-level API functions like httpx.get(..., proxies=...) . Note: SOCKS proxies are not supported yet. Diagram of how a proxy works (source: Wikipedia). The left hand side \"Internet\" blob may be your HTTPX client requesting example.com through a proxy. Example To route all traffic (HTTP and HTTPS) to a proxy located at http://localhost:8030 , pass the proxy URL to the client... with httpx . Client ( proxies = \"http://localhost:8030\" ) as client : ... For more advanced use cases, pass a proxies dict . For example, to route HTTP and HTTPS requests to 2 different proxies, respectively located at http://localhost:8030 , and http://localhost:8031 , pass a dict of proxy URLs: proxies = { \"http://\" : \"http://localhost:8030\" , \"https://\" : \"http://localhost:8031\" , } with httpx . Client ( proxies = proxies ) as client : ... For detailed information about proxy routing, see the Routing section. Gotcha In most cases, the proxy URL for the https:// key should use the http:// scheme (that's not a typo!). This is because HTTP proxying requires initiating a connection with the proxy server. While it's possible that your proxy supports doing it via HTTPS, most proxies only support doing it via HTTP. For more information, see FORWARD vs TUNNEL . Authentication Proxy credentials can be passed as the userinfo section of the proxy URL. For example: proxies = { \"http://\" : \"http://username:password@localhost:8030\" , # ... } Routing HTTPX provides fine-grained controls for deciding which requests should go through a proxy, and which shouldn't. This process is known as proxy routing. The proxies dictionary maps URL patterns (\"proxy keys\") to proxy URLs. HTTPX matches requested URLs against proxy keys to decide which proxy should be used, if any. Matching is done from most specific proxy keys (e.g. https://<domain>:<port> ) to least specific ones (e.g. https:// ). HTTPX supports routing proxies based on scheme , domain , port , or a combination of these. Wildcard routing Route everything through a proxy... proxies = { \"all://\" : \"http://localhost:8030\" , } Scheme routing Route HTTP requests through one proxy, and HTTPS requests through another... proxies = { \"http://\" : \"http://localhost:8030\" , \"https://\" : \"http://localhost:8031\" , } Domain routing Proxy all requests on domain \"example.com\", let other requests pass through... proxies = { \"all://example.com\" : \"http://localhost:8030\" , } Proxy HTTP requests on domain \"example.com\", let HTTPS and other requests pass through... proxies = { \"http://example.com\" : \"http://localhost:8030\" , } Proxy all requests to \"example.com\" and its subdomains, let other requests pass through... proxies = { \"all://*example.com\" : \"http://localhost:8030\" , } Proxy all requests to strict subdomains of \"example.com\", let \"example.com\" and other requests pass through... proxies = { \"all://*.example.com\" : \"http://localhost:8030\" , } Port routing Proxy HTTPS requests on port 1234 to \"example.com\"... proxies = { \"https://example.com:1234\" : \"http://localhost:8030\" , } Proxy all requests on port 1234... proxies = { \"all://*:1234\" : \"http://localhost:8030\" , } No-proxy support It is also possible to define requests that shouldn't be routed through proxies. To do so, pass None as the proxy URL. For example... proxies = { # Route requests through a proxy by default... \"all://\" : \"http://localhost:8031\" , # Except those for \"example.com\". \"all://example.com\" : None , } Complex configuration example You can combine the routing features outlined above to build complex proxy routing configurations. For example... proxies = { # Route all traffic through a proxy by default... \"all://\" : \"http://localhost:8030\" , # But don't use proxies for HTTPS requests to \"domain.io\"... \"https://domain.io\" : None , # And use another proxy for requests to \"example.com\" and its subdomains... \"all://*example.com\" : \"http://localhost:8031\" , # And yet another proxy if HTTP is used, # and the \"internal\" subdomain on port 5550 is requested... \"http://internal.example.com:5550\" : \"http://localhost:8032\" , } Environment variables HTTP proxying can also be configured through environment variables, although with less fine-grained control. See documentation on HTTP_PROXY , HTTPS_PROXY , ALL_PROXY for more information. Proxy mechanisms Note This section describes advanced proxy concepts and functionality. FORWARD vs TUNNEL In general, the flow for making an HTTP request through a proxy is as follows: The client connects to the proxy (initial connection request). The proxy somehow transfers data to the server on your behalf. How exactly step 2/ is performed depends on which of two proxying mechanisms is used: Forwarding : the proxy makes the request for you, and sends back the response it obtained from the server. Tunneling : the proxy establishes a TCP connection to the server on your behalf, and the client reuses this connection to send the request and receive the response. This is known as an HTTP Tunnel . This mechanism is how you can access websites that use HTTPS from an HTTP proxy (the client \"upgrades\" the connection to HTTPS by performing the TLS handshake with the server over the TCP connection provided by the proxy). Default behavior Given the technical definitions above, by default (and regardless of whether you're using an HTTP or HTTPS proxy), HTTPX will: Use forwarding for HTTP requests. Use tunneling for HTTPS requests. This ensures that you can make HTTP and HTTPS requests in all cases (i.e. regardless of which type of proxy you're using). Forcing the proxy mechanism In most cases, the default behavior should work just fine as well as provide enough security. But if you know what you're doing and you want to force which mechanism to use, you can do so by passing an httpx.Proxy() instance, setting the mode to either FORWARD_ONLY or TUNNEL_ONLY . For example... # Route all requests through an HTTPS proxy, using tunneling only. proxies = httpx . Proxy ( url = \"https://localhost:8030\" , mode = \"TUNNEL_ONLY\" , ) with httpx . Client ( proxies = proxies ) as client : # This HTTP request will be tunneled instead of forwarded. r = client . get ( \"http://example.com\" ) Troubleshooting proxies If you encounter issues when setting up proxies, please refer to our Troubleshooting guide . Timeout Configuration HTTPX is careful to enforce timeouts everywhere by default. The default behavior is to raise a TimeoutException after 5 seconds of network inactivity. Setting and disabling timeouts You can set timeouts for an individual request: # Using the top-level API: httpx . get ( 'http://example.com/api/v1/example' , timeout = 10.0 ) # Using a client instance: with httpx . Client () as client : client . get ( \"http://example.com/api/v1/example\" , timeout = 10.0 ) Or disable timeouts for an individual request: # Using the top-level API: httpx . get ( 'http://example.com/api/v1/example' , timeout = None ) # Using a client instance: with httpx . Client () as client : client . get ( \"http://example.com/api/v1/example\" , timeout = None ) Setting a default timeout on a client You can set a timeout on a client instance, which results in the given timeout being used as the default for requests made with this client: client = httpx . Client () # Use a default 5s timeout everywhere. client = httpx . Client ( timeout = 10.0 ) # Use a default 10s timeout everywhere. client = httpx . Client ( timeout = None ) # Disable all timeouts by default. Fine tuning the configuration HTTPX also allows you to specify the timeout behavior in more fine grained detail. There are four different types of timeouts that may occur. These are connect , read , write , and pool timeouts. The connect timeout specifies the maximum amount of time to wait until a socket connection to the requested host is established. If HTTPX is unable to connect within this time frame, a ConnectTimeout exception is raised. The read timeout specifies the maximum duration to wait for a chunk of data to be received (for example, a chunk of the response body). If HTTPX is unable to receive data within this time frame, a ReadTimeout exception is raised. The write timeout specifies the maximum duration to wait for a chunk of data to be sent (for example, a chunk of the request body). If HTTPX is unable to send data within this time frame, a WriteTimeout exception is raised. The pool timeout specifies the maximum duration to wait for acquiring a connection from the connection pool. If HTTPX is unable to acquire a connection within this time frame, a PoolTimeout exception is raised. A related configuration here is the maximum number of allowable connections in the connection pool, which is configured by the limits argument. You can configure the timeout behavior for any of these values... # A client with a 60s timeout for connecting, and a 10s timeout elsewhere. timeout = httpx . Timeout ( 10.0 , connect = 60.0 ) client = httpx . Client ( timeout = timeout ) response = client . get ( 'http://example.com/' ) Pool limit configuration You can control the connection pool size using the limits keyword argument on the client. It takes instances of httpx.Limits which define: max_keepalive , number of allowable keep-alive connections, or None to always allow. (Defaults 20) max_connections , maximum number of allowable connections, or None for no limits. (Default 100) limits = httpx . Limits ( max_keepalive_connections = 5 , max_connections = 10 ) client = httpx . Client ( limits = limits ) Multipart file encoding As mentioned in the quickstart multipart file encoding is available by passing a dictionary with the name of the payloads as keys and either tuple of elements or a file-like object or a string as values. >>> files = { 'upload-file' : ( 'report.xls' , open ( 'report.xls' , 'rb' ), 'application/vnd.ms-excel' )} >>> r = httpx . post ( \"https://httpbin.org/post\" , files = files ) >>> print ( r . text ) { ... \"files\": { \"upload-file\": \"<... binary content ...>\" }, ... } More specifically, if a tuple is used as a value, it must have between 2 and 3 elements: The first element is an optional file name which can be set to None . The second element may be a file-like object or a string which will be automatically encoded in UTF-8. An optional third element can be used to specify the MIME type of the file being uploaded. If not specified HTTPX will attempt to guess the MIME type based on the file name, with unknown file extensions defaulting to \"application/octet-stream\". If the file name is explicitly set to None then HTTPX will not include a content-type MIME header field. >>> files = { 'upload-file' : ( None , 'text content' , 'text/plain' )} >>> r = httpx . post ( \"https://httpbin.org/post\" , files = files ) >>> print ( r . text ) { ... \"files\": {}, \"form\": { \"upload-file\": \"text-content\" }, ... } Tip It is safe to upload large files this way. File uploads are streaming by default, meaning that only one chunk will be loaded into memory at a time. Non-file data fields can be included in the multipart form using by passing them to data=... . You can also send multiple files in one go with a multiple file field form. To do that, pass a list of (field, <file>) items instead of a dictionary, allowing you to pass multiple items with the same field . For instance this request sends 2 files, foo.png and bar.png in one request on the images form field: >>> files = [( 'images' , ( 'foo.png' , open ( 'foo.png' , 'rb' ), 'image/png' )), ('images', ('bar.png', open('bar.png', 'rb'), 'image/png'))] >>> r = httpx . post ( \"https://httpbin.org/post\" , files = files ) Customizing authentication When issuing requests or instantiating a client, the auth argument can be used to pass an authentication scheme to use. The auth argument may be one of the following... A two-tuple of username / password , to be used with basic authentication. An instance of httpx.BasicAuth() or httpx.DigestAuth() . A callable, accepting a request and returning an authenticated request instance. A subclass of httpx.Auth . The most involved of these is the last, which allows you to create authentication flows involving one or more requests. A subclass of httpx.Auth should implement def auth_flow(request) , and yield any requests that need to be made... class MyCustomAuth ( httpx . Auth ): def __init__ ( self , token ): self . token = token def auth_flow ( self , request ): # Send the request, with a custom `X-Authentication` header. request . headers [ 'X-Authentication' ] = self . token yield request If the auth flow requires more that one request, you can issue multiple yields, and obtain the response in each case... class MyCustomAuth ( httpx . Auth ): def __init__ ( self , token ): self . token = token def auth_flow ( self , request ): response = yield request if response . status_code == 401 : # If the server issues a 401 response then resend the request, # with a custom `X-Authentication` header. request . headers [ 'X-Authentication' ] = self . token yield request Custom authentication classes are designed to not perform any I/O, so that they may be used with both sync and async client instances. If you are implementing an authentication scheme that requires the request body, then you need to indicate this on the class using a requires_request_body property. You will then be able to access request.content inside the .auth_flow() method. class MyCustomAuth ( httpx . Auth ): requires_request_body = True def __init__ ( self , token ): self . token = token def auth_flow ( self , request ): response = yield request if response . status_code == 401 : # If the server issues a 401 response then resend the request, # with a custom `X-Authentication` header. request . headers [ 'X-Authentication' ] = self . sign_request ( ... ) yield request def sign_request ( self , request ): # Create a request signature, based on `request.method`, `request.url`, # `request.headers`, and `request.content`. ... Similarly, if you are implementing a scheme that requires access to the response body, then use the requires_response_body property. You will then be able to access response body properties and methods such as response.content , response.text , response.json() , etc. class MyCustomAuth ( httpx . Auth ): requires_response_body = True def __init__ ( self , access_token , refresh_token , refresh_url ): self . access_token = access_token self . refresh_token = refresh_token self . refresh_url = refresh_url def auth_flow ( self , request ): request . headers [ \"X-Authentication\" ] = self . access_token response = yield request if response . status_code == 401 : # If the server issues a 401 response, then issue a request to # refresh tokens, and resend the request. refresh_response = yield self . build_refresh_request () self . update_tokens ( refresh_response ) request . headers [ \"X-Authentication\" ] = self . access_token yield request def build_refresh_request ( self ): # Return an `httpx.Request` for refreshing tokens. ... def update_tokens ( self , response ): # Update the `.access_token` and `.refresh_token` tokens # based on a refresh response. data = response . json () ... If you do need to perform I/O other than HTTP requests, such as accessing a disk-based cache, or you need to use concurrency primitives, such as locks, then you should override .sync_auth_flow() and .async_auth_flow() (instead of .auth_flow() ). The former will be used by httpx.Client , while the latter will be used by httpx.AsyncClient . import asyncio import threading import httpx class MyCustomAuth ( httpx . Auth ): def __init__ ( self ): self . _sync_lock = threading . RLock () self . _async_lock = asyncio . Lock () def sync_get_token ( self ): with self . _sync_lock : ... def sync_auth_flow ( self , request ): token = self . sync_get_token () request . headers [ \"Authorization\" ] = f \"Token { token } \" yield request async def async_get_token ( self ): async with self . _async_lock : ... async def async_auth_flow ( self , request ): token = await self . async_get_token () request . headers [ \"Authorization\" ] = f \"Token { token } \" yield request If you only want to support one of the two methods, then you should still override it, but raise an explicit RuntimeError . import httpx import sync_only_library class MyCustomAuth ( httpx . Auth ): def sync_auth_flow ( self , request ): token = sync_only_library . get_token ( ... ) request . headers [ \"Authorization\" ] = f \"Token { token } \" yield request async def async_auth_flow ( self , request ): raise RuntimeError ( \"Cannot use a sync authentication class with httpx.AsyncClient\" ) SSL certificates When making a request over HTTPS, HTTPX needs to verify the identity of the requested host. To do this, it uses a bundle of SSL certificates (a.k.a. CA bundle) delivered by a trusted certificate authority (CA). Changing the verification defaults By default, HTTPX uses the CA bundle provided by Certifi . This is what you want in most cases, even though some advanced situations may require you to use a different set of certificates. If you'd like to use a custom CA bundle, you can use the verify parameter. import httpx r = httpx . get ( \"https://example.org\" , verify = \"path/to/client.pem\" ) Alternatively, you can pass a standard library ssl.SSLContext . >>> import ssl >>> import httpx >>> context = ssl . create_default_context () >>> context . load_verify_locations ( cafile = \"/tmp/client.pem\" ) >>> httpx . get ( 'https://example.org' , verify = context ) <Response [200 OK]> We also include a helper function for creating properly configured SSLContext instances. >>> context = httpx . create_ssl_context () The create_ssl_context function accepts the same set of SSL configuration arguments ( trust_env , verify , cert and http2 arguments) as httpx.Client or httpx.AsyncClient >>> import httpx >>> context = httpx . create_ssl_context ( verify = \"/tmp/client.pem\" ) >>> httpx . get ( 'https://example.org' , verify = context ) <Response [200 OK]> Or you can also disable the SSL verification entirely, which is not recommended. import httpx r = httpx . get ( \"https://example.org\" , verify = False ) SSL configuration on client instances If you're using a Client() instance, then you should pass any SSL settings when instantiating the client. client = httpx . Client ( verify = False ) The client.get(...) method and other request methods do not support changing the SSL settings on a per-request basis. If you need different SSL settings in different cases you should use more that one client instance, with different settings on each. Each client will then be using an isolated connection pool with a specific fixed SSL configuration on all connections within that pool. Client Side Certificates You can also specify a local cert to use as a client-side certificate, either a path to an SSL certificate file, or two-tuple of (certificate file, key file), or a three-tuple of (certificate file, key file, password) import httpx r = httpx . get ( \"https://example.org\" , cert = \"path/to/client.pem\" ) Alternatively, >>> cert = ( \"path/to/client.pem\" , \"path/to/client.key\" ) >>> httpx . get ( \"https://example.org\" , cert = cert ) <Response [200 OK]> or >>> cert = ( \"path/to/client.pem\" , \"path/to/client.key\" , \"password\" ) >>> httpx . get ( \"https://example.org\" , cert = cert ) <Response [200 OK]> Making HTTPS requests to a local server When making requests to local servers, such as a development server running on localhost , you will typically be using unencrypted HTTP connections. If you do need to make HTTPS connections to a local server, for example to test an HTTPS-only service, you will need to create and use your own certificates. Here's one way to do it: Use trustme-cli to generate a pair of server key/cert files, and a client cert file. Pass the server key/cert files when starting your local server. (This depends on the particular web server you're using. For example, Uvicorn provides the --ssl-keyfile and --ssl-certfile options.) Tell HTTPX to use the certificates stored in client.pem : >>> import httpx >>> r = httpx . get ( \"https://localhost:8000\" , verify = \"/tmp/client.pem\" ) >>> r Response <200 OK> Custom Transports HTTPX's Client also accepts a transport argument. This argument allows you to provide a custom Transport object that will be used to perform the actual sending of the requests. Usage For some advanced configuration you might need to instantiate a transport class directly, and pass it to the client instance. One example is the local_address configuration which is only available via this low-level API. >>> import httpx >>> transport = httpx .

HTTPTransport ( retries = 1 ) >>> client = httpx .

Client ( transport = URLLib3Transport ()) >>> client . get ( \"https://example.org\" ) <Response [200 OK]> Writing custom transports A transport instance must implement the low-level Transport API, which deals with sending a single request, and returning a response. You should either subclass httpx.BaseTransport to implement a transport to use with Client , or subclass httpx.AsyncBaseTransport to implement a transport to use with AsyncClient . At the layer of the transport API we're using plain primitives. No Request or Response models, no fancy URL or Header handling. This strict point of cut-off provides a clear design separation between the HTTPX API, and the low-level network handling. See the handle_request and handle_async_request docstrings for more details on the specifics of the Transport API. A complete example of a custom transport implementation would be: import json import httpx class HelloWorldTransport ( httpx . BaseTransport ): \"\"\" A mock transport that always returns a JSON \"Hello, world!\" response. \"\"\" def handle_request ( self , method , url , headers , stream , extensions ): message = { \"text\" : \"Hello, world!\" } content = json . dumps ( message ) . encode ( \"utf-8\" ) stream = httpx . ByteStream ( content ) headers = [( b \"content-type\" , b \"application/json\" )] extensions = {} return 200 , headers , stream , extensions Which we can use in the same way: >>> import httpx >>> client = httpx . Client ( transport = HelloWorldTransport ()) >>> response = client . get ( \"https://example.org/\" ) >>> response . json () {\"text\": \"Hello, world!\"} Mock transports During testing it can often be useful to be able to mock out a transport, and return pre-determined responses, rather than making actual network requests. The httpx.MockTransport class accepts a handler function, which can be used to map requests onto pre-determined responses: def handler ( request ): return httpx . Response ( 200 , json = { \"text\" : \"Hello, world!\" }) # Switch to a mock transport, if the TESTING environment variable is set. if os . environ . get ( 'TESTING' , '' ) . upper () == \"TRUE\" : transport = httpx . MockTransport ( handler ) else : transport = httpx . HTTPTransport () client = httpx . Client ( transport = transport ) For more advanced use-cases you might want to take a look at either the third-party mocking library, RESPX , or the pytest-httpx library . Mounting transports You can also mount transports against given schemes or domains, to control which transport an outgoing request should be routed via, with the same style used for specifying proxy routing . import httpx class HTTPSRedirectTransport ( httpx . BaseTransport ): \"\"\" A transport that always redirects to HTTPS. \"\"\" def handle_request ( self , method , url , headers , stream , extensions ): scheme , host , port , path = url if port is None : location = b \"https:// %s%s \" % ( host , path ) else : location = b \"https:// %s : %d%s \" % ( host , port , path ) stream = httpx .

Client ( mounts = mounts ) A couple of other sketches of how you might take advantage of mounted transports... Disabling HTTP/2 on a single given domain... mounts = { \"all://\" : httpx . HTTPTransport ( http2 = True ), \"all://*example.org\" : httpx . HTTPTransport () } client = httpx .

Async is a concurrency model that is far more efficient than multi-threading, and can provide significant performance benefits and enable the use of long-lived network connections such as WebSockets. If you're working with an async web framework then you'll also want to use an async client for sending outgoing HTTP requests. Making Async requests To make asynchronous requests, you'll need an AsyncClient . >>> async with httpx . AsyncClient () as client : ... r = await client . get ( 'https://www.example.com/' ) ... >>> r <Response [200 OK]> Tip Use IPython or Python 3.8+ with python -m asyncio to try this code interactively, as they support executing async / await expressions in the console. API Differences If you're using an async client then there are a few bits of API that use async methods. Making requests The request methods are all async, so you should use response = await client.get(...) style for all of the following: AsyncClient.get(url, ...) AsyncClient.options(url, ...) AsyncClient.head(url, ...) AsyncClient.post(url, ...) AsyncClient.put(url, ...) AsyncClient.patch(url, ...) AsyncClient.delete(url, ...) AsyncClient.request(method, url, ...) AsyncClient.send(request, ...) Opening and closing clients Use async with httpx.AsyncClient() if you want a context-managed client... async with httpx . AsyncClient () as client : ... Alternatively, use await client.aclose() if you want to close a client explicitly: client = httpx . AsyncClient () ... await client . aclose () Streaming responses The AsyncClient.stream(method, url, ...) method is an async context block. >>> client = httpx . AsyncClient () >>> async with client . stream ( 'GET' , 'https://www.example.com/' ) as response : ... async for chunk in response . aiter_bytes (): ... ... The async response streaming methods are: Response.aread() - For conditionally reading a response inside a stream block. Response.aiter_bytes() - For streaming the response content as bytes. Response.aiter_text() - For streaming the response content as text. Response.aiter_lines() - For streaming the response content as lines of text. Response.aiter_raw() - For streaming the raw response bytes, without applying content decoding. Response.aclose() - For closing the response. You don't usually need this, since .stream block closes the response automatically on exit. For situations when context block usage is not practical, it is possible to enter \"manual mode\" by sending a Request instance using client.send(..., stream=True) . Example in the context of forwarding the response to a streaming web endpoint with Starlette : import httpx from starlette.background import BackgroundTask from starlette.responses import StreamingResponse client = httpx . AsyncClient () async def home ( request ): req = client . build_request ( \"GET\" , \"https://www.example.com/\" ) r = await client . send ( req , stream = True ) return StreamingResponse ( r . aiter_text (), background = BackgroundTask ( r . aclose )) Warning When using this \"manual streaming mode\", it is your duty as a developer to make sure that Response.aclose() is called eventually. Failing to do so would leave connections open, most likely resulting in resource leaks down the line. Streaming requests When sending a streaming request body with an AsyncClient instance, you should use an async bytes generator instead of a bytes generator: async def upload_bytes (): ... # yield byte content await client . post ( url , data = upload_bytes ()) Explicit transport instances When instantiating a transport instance directly, you need to use httpx.AsyncHTTPTransport . For instance: >>> import httpx >>> transport = httpx . AsyncHTTPTransport ( retries = 1 ) >>> async with httpx . AsyncClient ( transport = transport ) as client : >>> ... Supported async environments HTTPX supports either asyncio or trio as an async environment. It will auto-detect which of those two to use as the backend for socket operations and concurrency primitives. AsyncIO AsyncIO is Python's built-in library for writing concurrent code with the async/await syntax. import asyncio import httpx async def main (): async with httpx . AsyncClient () as client : response = await client . get ( 'https://www.example.com/' ) print ( response ) asyncio . run ( main ()) Trio Trio is an alternative async library , designed around the the principles of structured concurrency . import httpx import trio async def main (): async with httpx . AsyncClient () as client : response = await client . get ( 'https://www.example.com/' ) print ( response ) trio . run ( main ) Important The trio package must be installed to use the Trio backend. Curio Curio is a coroutine-based library for concurrent Python systems programming. import httpx import curio async def main (): async with httpx . AsyncClient () as client : response = await client . get ( 'https://www.example.com/' ) print ( response ) curio . run ( main ) Important The curio package must be installed to use the Curio backend. AnyIO AnyIO is an asynchronous networking and concurrency library that works on top of either asyncio or trio . It blends in with native libraries of your chosen backend (defaults to asyncio ). import httpx import anyio async def main (): async with httpx . AsyncClient () as client : response = await client . get ( 'https://www.example.com/' ) print ( response ) anyio . run ( main , backend = 'trio' ) When instantiating a transport instance explicitly, for maximum consistency, the same backend parameter can be passed to AsyncHTTPTransport . transport = httpx . AsyncHTTPTransport ( backend = \"trio\" ) Calling into Python Web Apps Just as httpx.Client allows you to call directly into WSGI web applications, the httpx.AsyncClient class allows you to call directly into ASGI web applications. Let's take this Starlette application as an example: from starlette.applications import Starlette from starlette.responses import HTMLResponse from starlette.routing import Route async def hello ( request ): return HTMLResponse ( \"Hello World!\" ) app = Starlette ( routes = [ Route ( \"/\" , hello )]) We can make requests directly against the application, like so: >>> import httpx >>> async with httpx . AsyncClient ( app = app , base_url = \"http://testserver\" ) as client : ... r = await client . get ( \"/\" ) ... assert r . status_code == 200 ... assert r . text == \"Hello World!\" For some more complex cases you might need to customise the ASGI transport. This allows you to: Inspect 500 error responses rather than raise exceptions by setting raise_app_exceptions=False . Mount the ASGI application at a subpath by setting root_path . Use a given client address for requests by setting client . For example: # Instantiate a client that makes ASGI requests with a client IP of \"1.2.3.4\", # on port 123. transport = httpx . ASGITransport ( app = app , client = ( \"1.2.3.4\" , 123 )) async with httpx . AsyncClient ( transport = transport , base_url = \"http://testserver\" ) as client : ... See the ASGI documentation for more details on the client and root_path keys.

This documentation outlines places where the API differs... Request URLs Accessing response.url will return a URL instance, rather than a string. Use str(response.url) if you need a string instance. Request Content For uploading raw text or binary content we prefer to use a content parameter, in order to better separate this usage from the case of uploading form data. For example, using content=... to upload raw content: # Uploading text, bytes, or a bytes iterator. httpx . post ( ... , content = b \"Hello, world\" ) And using data=... to send form data: # Uploading form data. httpx . post ( ... , data = { \"message\" : \"Hello, world\" }) Using the data=<text/byte content> will raise a deprecation warning, and is expected to be fully removed with the HTTPX 1.0 release. Content encoding HTTPX uses utf-8 for encoding str request bodies. For example, when using content=<str> the request body will be encoded to utf-8 before being sent over the wire. This differs from Requests which uses latin1 . If you need an explicit encoding, pass encoded bytes explictly, e.g. content=<str>.encode(\"latin1\") . For response bodies, assuming the server didn't send an explicit encoding then HTTPX will do its best to figure out an appropriate encoding. Unlike Requests which uses the chardet library, HTTPX relies on a plainer fallback strategy (basically attempting UTF-8, or using Windows-1252 as a fallback). This strategy should be robust enough to handle the vast majority of use cases. Cookies If using a client instance, then cookies should always be set on the client rather than on a per-request basis. This usage is supported: client = httpx . Client ( cookies =... ) client . post ( ... ) This usage is not supported: client = httpx . Client () client . post ( ... , cookies =... ) We prefer enforcing a stricter API here because it provides clearer expectations around cookie persistence, particularly when redirects occur. Status Codes In our documentation we prefer the uppercased versions, such as codes.NOT_FOUND , but also provide lower-cased versions for API compatibility with requests . Requests includes various synonyms for status codes that HTTPX does not support. Streaming responses HTTPX provides a .stream() interface rather than using stream=True . This ensures that streaming responses are always properly closed outside of the stream block, and makes it visually clearer at which points streaming I/O APIs may be used with a response. For example: with request . stream ( \"GET\" , \"https://www.example.com\" ) as response : ... Within a stream() block request data is made available with: .iter_bytes() - Instead of response.iter_content() .iter_text() - Instead of response.iter_content(decode_unicode=True) .iter_lines() - Corresponding to response.iter_lines() .iter_raw() - Use this instead of response.raw .read() - Read the entire response body, making request.text and response.content available. Proxy keys When using httpx.Client(proxies={...}) to map to a selection of different proxies, we use full URL schemes, such as proxies={\"http://\": ..., \"https://\": ...} . This is different to the requests usage of proxies={\"http\": ..., \"https\": ...} . This change is for better consistency with more complex mappings, that might also include domain names, such as proxies={\"all://\": ..., \"all://www.example.com\": None} which maps all requests onto a proxy, except for requests to \"www.example.com\" which have an explicit exclusion. Also note that requests.Session.request(...) allows a proxies=... parameter, whereas httpx.Client.request(...) does not. SSL configuration When using a Client instance, the trust_env , verify , and cert arguments should always be passed on client instantiation, rather than passed to the request method. If you need more than one different SSL configuration, you should use different client instances for each SSL configuration. Requests supports REQUESTS_CA_BUNDLE which points to either a file or a directory. HTTPX supports the SSL_CERT_FILE (for a file) and SSL_CERT_DIR (for a directory) OpenSSL variables instead. Request body on HTTP methods The HTTP GET , DELETE , HEAD , and OPTIONS methods are specified as not supporting a request body. To stay in line with this, the .get , .delete , .head and .options functions do not support files , data , or json arguments. If you really do need to send request data using these http methods you should use the generic .request function instead. Checking for 4xx/5xx responses We don't support response.is_ok since the naming is ambiguous there, and might incorrectly imply an equivalence to response.status_code == codes.OK . Instead we provide the response.is_error property. Use if not response.is_error: instead of if response.is_ok: . Client instances The HTTPX equivalent of requests.Session is httpx.Client . session = requests . Session ( ** kwargs ) is generally equivalent to client = httpx . Client ( ** kwargs ) Request instantiation There is no notion of prepared requests in HTTPX. If you need to customize request instantiation, see Request instances . Besides, httpx.Request() does not support the auth , timeout , allow_redirects , proxies , verify and cert parameters. However these are available in httpx.request , httpx.get , httpx.post etc., as well as on Client instances . Mocking If you need to mock HTTPX the same way that test utilities like responses and requests-mock does for requests , see RESPX . Networking layer requests defers most of its HTTP networking code to the excellent urllib3 library . On the other hand, HTTPX uses HTTPCore as its core HTTP networking layer, which is a different project than urllib3 . Query Parameters requests omits params whose values are None (e.g. requests.get(..., params={\"foo\": None}) ). This is not supported by HTTPX. HEAD redirection In requests , all top-level API follow redirects by default except HEAD . In consideration of consistency, we make HEAD follow redirects by default in HTTPX. Determining the next redirect request When using allow_redirects=False , the requests library exposes an attribute response.next , which can be used to obtain the next redirect request. In HTTPX, this attribute is instead named response.next_request . For example: client = httpx . Client () request = client . build_request ( \"GET\" , ... ) while request is not None : response = client . send ( request , allow_redirects = False ) request = response . next_request Event Hooks requests allows event hooks to mutate Request and Response objects. See examples given in the documentation for requests . In HTTPX, event hooks may access properties of requests and responses, but event hook callbacks cannot mutate the original request/response.

There are many ways you can contribute to the project: Try HTTPX and report bugs/issues you find Implement new features Review Pull Requests of others Write documentation Participate in discussions Reporting Bugs or Other Issues Found something that HTTPX should support? Stumbled upon some unexpected behaviour? Contributions should generally start out with a discussion . Possible bugs may be raised as a \"Potential Issue\" discussion, feature requests may be raised as an \"Ideas\" discussion. We can then determine if the discussion needs to be escalated into an \"Issue\" or not, or if we'd consider a pull request. Try to be more descriptive as you can and in case of a bug report, provide as much information as possible like: OS platform Python version Installed dependencies and versions ( python -m pip freeze ) Code snippet Error traceback You should always try to reduce any examples to the simplest possible case that demonstrates the issue. Some possibly useful tips for narrowing down potential issues... Does the issue exist on HTTP/1.1, or HTTP/2, or both? Does the issue exist with Client , AsyncClient , or both? When using AsyncClient does the issue exist when using asyncio or trio , or both? Development To start developing HTTPX create a fork of the HTTPX repository on GitHub. Then clone your fork with the following command replacing YOUR-USERNAME with your GitHub username: $ git clone https://github.com/YOUR-USERNAME/httpx You can now install the project and its dependencies using: $ cd httpx $ scripts/install Testing and Linting We use custom shell scripts to automate testing, linting, and documentation building workflow. To run the tests, use: $ scripts/test Warning The test suite spawns testing servers on ports 8000 and 8001 . Make sure these are not in use, so the tests can run properly. Any additional arguments will be passed to pytest . See the pytest documentation for more information. For example, to run a single test script: $ scripts/test tests/test_multipart.py To run the code auto-formatting: $ scripts/lint Lastly, to run code checks separately (they are also run as part of scripts/test ), run: $ scripts/check Documenting Documentation pages are located under the docs/ folder. To run the documentation site locally (useful for previewing changes), use: $ scripts/docs Resolving Build / CI Failures Once you've submitted your pull request, the test suite will automatically run, and the results will show up in GitHub. If the test suite fails, you'll want to click through to the \"Details\" link, and try to identify why the test suite failed. Here are some common ways the test suite can fail: Check Job Failed This job failing means there is either a code formatting issue or type-annotation issue. You can look at the job output to figure out why it's failed or within a shell run: $ scripts/check It may be worth it to run $ scripts/lint to attempt auto-formatting the code and if that job succeeds commit the changes. Docs Job Failed This job failing means the documentation failed to build. This can happen for a variety of reasons like invalid markdown or missing configuration within mkdocs.yml . Python 3.X Job Failed This job failing means the unit tests failed or not all code paths are covered by unit tests. If tests are failing you will see this message under the coverage report: === 1 failed, 435 passed, 1 skipped, 1 xfailed in 11.09s === If tests succeed but coverage doesn't reach our current threshold, you will see this message under the coverage report: FAIL Required test coverage of 100% not reached. Total coverage: 99.00% Releasing This section is targeted at HTTPX maintainers. Before releasing a new version, create a pull request that includes: An update to the changelog : We follow the format from keepachangelog . Compare master with the tag of the latest release, and list all entries that are of interest to our users: Things that must go in the changelog: added, changed, deprecated or removed features, and bug fixes. Things that should not go in the changelog: changes to documentation, tests or tooling. Try sorting entries in descending order of impact / importance. Keep it concise and to-the-point. \ud83c\udfaf A version bump : see __version__.py . For an example, see #1006 . Once the release PR is merged, create a new release including: Tag version like 0.13.3 . Release title Version 0.13.3 Description copied from the changelog. Once created this release will be automatically uploaded to PyPI. If something goes wrong with the PyPI job the release can be published using the scripts/publish script. Development proxy setup To test and debug requests via a proxy it's best to run a proxy server locally. Any server should do but HTTPCore's test suite uses mitmproxy which is written in Python, it's fully featured and has excellent UI and tools for introspection of requests. You can install mitmproxy using pip install mitmproxy or several other ways . mitmproxy does require setting up local TLS certificates for HTTPS requests, as its main purpose is to allow developers to inspect requests that pass through it. We can set them up follows: pip install trustme-cli . trustme-cli -i example.org www.example.org , assuming you want to test connecting to that domain, this will create three files: server.pem , server.key and client.pem . mitmproxy requires a PEM file that includes the private key and the certificate so we need to concatenate them: cat server.key server.pem > server.withkey.pem . Start the proxy server mitmproxy --certs server.withkey.pem , or use the other mitmproxy commands with different UI options. At this point the server is ready to start serving requests, you'll need to configure HTTPX as described in the proxy section and the SSL certificates section , this is where our previously generated client.pem comes in: import httpx proxies = {\"all\": \"http://127.0.0.1:8080/\"} with httpx.Client(proxies=proxies, verify=\"/path/to/client.pem\") as client: response = client.get(\"https://example.org\") print(response.status_code) # should print 200 Note, however, that HTTPS requests will only succeed to the host specified in the SSL/TLS certificate we generated, HTTPS requests to other hosts will raise an error like: ssl.SSLCertVerificationError: [SSL: CERTIFICATE_VERIFY_FAILED] certificate verify failed: Hostname mismatch, certificate is not valid for 'duckduckgo.com'. (_ssl.c:1108) If you want to make requests to more hosts you'll need to regenerate the certificates and include all the hosts you intend to connect to in the seconds step, i.e. trustme-cli -i example.org www.example.org duckduckgo.com www.duckduckgo.com","title":"Contributing"},{"location":"contributing/#contributing","text":"Thank you for being interested in contributing to HTTPX.

Possible bugs may be raised as a \"Potential Issue\" discussion, feature requests may be raised as an \"Ideas\" discussion. We can then determine if the discussion needs to be escalated into an \"Issue\" or not, or if we'd consider a pull request. Try to be more descriptive as you can and in case of a bug report, provide as much information as possible like: OS platform Python version Installed dependencies and versions ( python -m pip freeze ) Code snippet Error traceback You should always try to reduce any examples to the simplest possible case that demonstrates the issue. Some possibly useful tips for narrowing down potential issues... Does the issue exist on HTTP/1.1, or HTTP/2, or both? Does the issue exist with Client , AsyncClient , or both?

Things that should not go in the changelog: changes to documentation, tests or tooling. Try sorting entries in descending order of impact / importance. Keep it concise and to-the-point. \ud83c\udfaf A version bump : see __version__.py . For an example, see #1006 . Once the release PR is merged, create a new release including: Tag version like 0.13.3 . Release title Version 0.13.3 Description copied from the changelog.

Any server should do but HTTPCore's test suite uses mitmproxy which is written in Python, it's fully featured and has excellent UI and tools for introspection of requests. You can install mitmproxy using pip install mitmproxy or several other ways . mitmproxy does require setting up local TLS certificates for HTTPS requests, as its main purpose is to allow developers to inspect requests that pass through it. We can set them up follows: pip install trustme-cli . trustme-cli -i example.org www.example.org , assuming you want to test connecting to that domain, this will create three files: server.pem , server.key and client.pem . mitmproxy requires a PEM file that includes the private key and the certificate so we need to concatenate them: cat server.key server.pem > server.withkey.pem . Start the proxy server mitmproxy --certs server.withkey.pem , or use the other mitmproxy commands with different UI options. At this point the server is ready to start serving requests, you'll need to configure HTTPX as described in the proxy section and the SSL certificates section , this is where our previously generated client.pem comes in: import httpx proxies = {\"all\": \"http://127.0.0.1:8080/\"} with httpx.Client(proxies=proxies, verify=\"/path/to/client.pem\") as client: response = client.get(\"https://example.org\") print(response.status_code) # should print 200 Note, however, that HTTPS requests will only succeed to the host specified in the SSL/TLS certificate we generated, HTTPS requests to other hosts will raise an error like: ssl.SSLCertVerificationError: [SSL: CERTIFICATE_VERIFY_FAILED] certificate verify failed: Hostname mismatch, certificate is not valid for 'duckduckgo.com'. (_ssl.c:1108) If you want to make requests to more hosts you'll need to regenerate the certificates and include all the hosts you intend to connect to in the seconds step, i.e. trustme-cli -i example.org www.example.org duckduckgo.com www.duckduckgo.com","title":"Development proxy setup"},{"location":"environment_variables/","text":"Environment Variables The HTTPX library can be configured via environment variables. Environment variables are used by default. To ignore environment variables, trust_env has to be set False .

You can inspect what encoding will be used to decode the response. >>> r . encoding 'UTF-8' In some cases the response may not contain an explicit encoding, in which case HTTPX will attempt to automatically determine an encoding to use. This defaults to UTF-8, but also includes robust fallback behaviour for handling ascii, iso-8859-1 and windows 1252 encodings. >>> r . encoding None >>> r . text '<!doctype html>\\n<html>\\n<head>\\n<title>Example Domain</title>...' If you need to override the standard behaviour and explicitly set the encoding to use, then you can do that too. >>> r . encoding = 'ISO-8859-1' Binary Response Content The response content can also be accessed as bytes, for non-text responses: >>> r . content b'<!doctype html>\\n<html>\\n<head>\\n<title>Example Domain</title>...' Any gzip and deflate HTTP response encodings will automatically be decoded for you. If brotlipy is installed, then the brotli response encoding will also be supported. For example, to create an image from binary data returned by a request, you can use the following code: >>> from PIL import Image >>> from io import BytesIO >>> i = Image . open ( BytesIO ( r . content )) JSON Response Content Often Web API responses will be encoded as JSON. >>> r = httpx . get ( 'https://api.github.com/events' ) >>> r . json () [{u'repository': {u'open_issues': 0, u'url': 'https://github.com/...' ... }}] Custom Headers To include additional headers in the outgoing request, use the headers keyword argument: >>> url = 'http://httpbin.org/headers' >>> headers = { 'user-agent' : 'my-app/0.0.1' } >>> r = httpx . get ( url , headers = headers ) Sending Form Encoded Data Some types of HTTP requests, such as POST and PUT requests, can include data in the request body. One common way of including that is as form-encoded data, which is used for HTML forms. >>> data = { 'key1' : 'value1' , 'key2' : 'value2' } >>> r = httpx . post ( \"https://httpbin.org/post\" , data = data ) >>> print ( r . text ) { ... \"form\": { \"key2\": \"value2\", \"key1\": \"value1\" }, ... } Form encoded data can also include multiple values from a given key. >>> data = { 'key1' : [ 'value1' , 'value2' ]} >>> r = httpx . post ( \"https://httpbin.org/post\" , data = data ) >>> print ( r . text ) { ... \"form\": { \"key1\": [ \"value1\", \"value2\" ] }, ... } Sending Multipart File Uploads You can also upload files, using HTTP multipart encoding: >>> files = { 'upload-file' : open ( 'report.xls' , 'rb' )} >>> r = httpx . post ( \"https://httpbin.org/post\" , files = files ) >>> print ( r . text ) { ... \"files\": { \"upload-file\": \"<... binary content ...>\" }, ... } You can also explicitly set the filename and content type, by using a tuple of items for the file value: >>> files = { 'upload-file' : ( 'report.xls' , open ( 'report.xls' , 'rb' ), 'application/vnd.ms-excel' )} >>> r = httpx . post ( \"https://httpbin.org/post\" , files = files ) >>> print ( r . text ) { ... \"files\": { \"upload-file\": \"<... binary content ...>\" }, ... } If you need to include non-file data fields in the multipart form, use the data=... parameter: >>> data = { 'message' : 'Hello, world!' } >>> files = { 'file' : open ( 'report.xls' , 'rb' )} >>> r = httpx . post ( \"https://httpbin.org/post\" , data = data , files = files ) >>> print ( r . text ) { ... \"files\": { \"file\": \"<... binary content ...>\" }, \"form\": { \"message\": \"Hello, world!\", }, ... } Sending JSON Encoded Data Form encoded data is okay if all you need is a simple key-value data structure. For more complicated data structures you'll often want to use JSON encoding instead. >>> data = { 'integer' : 123 , 'boolean' : True , 'list' : [ 'a' , 'b' , 'c' ]} >>> r = httpx . post ( \"https://httpbin.org/post\" , json = data ) >>> print ( r . text ) { ... \"json\": { \"boolean\": true, \"integer\": 123, \"list\": [ \"a\", \"b\", \"c\" ] }, ... } Sending Binary Request Data For other encodings, you should use the content=... parameter, passing either a bytes type or a generator that yields bytes . >>> content = b 'Hello, world' >>> r = httpx . post ( \"https://httpbin.org/post\" , content = content ) You may also want to set a custom Content-Type header when uploading binary data. Response Status Codes We can inspect the HTTP status code of the response: >>> r = httpx . get ( 'https://httpbin.org/get' ) >>> r . status_code 200 HTTPX also includes an easy shortcut for accessing status codes by their text phrase. >>> r . status_code == httpx . codes . OK True We can raise an exception for any Client or Server error responses (4xx or 5xx status codes): >>> not_found = httpx . get ( 'https://httpbin.org/status/404' ) >>> not_found . status_code 404 >>> not_found . raise_for_status () Traceback (most recent call last): File \"/Users/tomchristie/GitHub/encode/httpcore/httpx/models.py\" , line 837 , in raise_for_status raise HTTPStatusError ( message , response = self ) httpx._exceptions.HTTPStatusError : 404 Client Error: Not Found for url: https://httpbin.org/status/404 For more information check: https://httpstatuses.com/404 Any successful response codes will simply return None rather than raising an exception. >>> r . raise_for_status () Response Headers The response headers are available as a dictionary-like interface. >>> r . headers Headers({ 'content-encoding': 'gzip', 'transfer-encoding': 'chunked', 'connection': 'close', 'server': 'nginx/1.0.4', 'x-runtime': '148ms', 'etag': '\"e1ca502697e5c9317743dc078f67693f\"', 'content-type': 'application/json' }) The Headers data type is case-insensitive, so you can use any capitalization. >>> r . headers [ 'Content-Type' ] 'application/json' >>> r . headers . get ( 'content-type' ) 'application/json' Multiple values for a single response header are represented as a single comma-separated value, as per RFC 7230 : A recipient MAY combine multiple header fields with the same field name into one \u201cfield-name: field-value\u201d pair, without changing the semantics of the message, by appending each subsequent field-value to the combined field value in order, separated by a comma. Streaming Responses For large downloads you may want to use streaming responses that do not load the entire response body into memory at once. You can stream the binary content of the response... >>> with httpx . stream ( \"GET\" , \"https://www.example.com\" ) as r : ... for data in r . iter_bytes (): ... print ( data ) Or the text of the response... >>> with httpx . stream ( \"GET\" , \"https://www.example.com\" ) as r : ... for text in r . iter_text (): ... print ( text ) Or stream the text, on a line-by-line basis... >>> with httpx . stream ( \"GET\" , \"https://www.example.com\" ) as r : ... for line in r . iter_lines (): ... print ( line ) HTTPX will use universal line endings, normalising all cases to \\n . In some cases you might want to access the raw bytes on the response without applying any HTTP content decoding. In this case any content encoding that the web server has applied such as gzip , deflate , or brotli will not be automatically decoded. >>> with httpx . stream ( \"GET\" , \"https://www.example.com\" ) as r : ... for chunk in r . iter_raw (): ... print ( chunk ) If you're using streaming responses in any of these ways then the response.content and response.text attributes will not be available, and will raise errors if accessed. However you can also use the response streaming functionality to conditionally load the response body: >>> with httpx . stream ( \"GET\" , \"https://www.example.com\" ) as r : ... if r . headers [ 'Content-Length' ] < TOO_LONG : ... r . read () ... print ( r . text ) Cookies Any cookies that are set on the response can be easily accessed: >>> r = httpx . get ( 'http://httpbin.org/cookies/set?chocolate=chip' , allow_redirects = False ) >>> r . cookies [ 'chocolate' ] 'chip' To include cookies in an outgoing request, use the cookies parameter: >>> cookies = { \"peanut\" : \"butter\" } >>> r = httpx . get ( 'http://httpbin.org/cookies' , cookies = cookies ) >>> r . json () {'cookies': {'peanut': 'butter'}} Cookies are returned in a Cookies instance, which is a dict-like data structure with additional API for accessing cookies by their domain or path. >>> cookies = httpx . Cookies () >>> cookies . set ( 'cookie_on_domain' , 'hello, there!' , domain = 'httpbin.org' ) >>> cookies . set ( 'cookie_off_domain' , 'nope.' , domain = 'example.org' ) >>> r = httpx . get ( 'http://httpbin.org/cookies' , cookies = cookies ) >>> r . json () {'cookies': {'cookie_on_domain': 'hello, there!'}} Redirection and History By default, HTTPX will follow redirects for all HTTP methods. The history property of the response can be used to inspect any followed redirects. It contains a list of any redirect responses that were followed, in the order in which they were made. For example, GitHub redirects all HTTP requests to HTTPS. >>> r = httpx . get ( 'http://github.com/' ) >>> r . url URL('https://github.com/') >>> r . status_code 200 >>> r . history [<Response [301 Moved Permanently]>] You can modify the default redirection handling with the allow_redirects parameter: >>> r = httpx . get ( 'http://github.com/' , allow_redirects = False ) >>> r . status_code 301 >>> r . history [] Timeouts HTTPX defaults to including reasonable timeouts for all network operations, meaning that if a connection is not properly established then it should always raise an error rather than hanging indefinitely. The default timeout for network inactivity is five seconds. You can modify the value to be more or less strict: >>> httpx . get ( 'https://github.com/' , timeout = 0.001 ) You can also disable the timeout behavior completely... >>> httpx . get ( 'https://github.com/' , timeout = None ) For advanced timeout management, see Timeout fine-tuning . Authentication HTTPX supports Basic and Digest HTTP authentication. To provide Basic authentication credentials, pass a 2-tuple of plaintext str or bytes objects as the auth argument to the request functions: >>> httpx . get ( \"https://example.com\" , auth = ( \"my_user\" , \"password123\" )) To provide credentials for Digest authentication you'll need to instantiate a DigestAuth object with the plaintext username and password as arguments. This object can be then passed as the auth argument to the request methods as above: >>> auth = httpx .
